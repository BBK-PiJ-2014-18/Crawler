### Crawler for CW5...

##### ...will finish on Monday 27th April...

Need to do last few things:

Tests to ensure stops after right number of links/depth.
Naming of database file passed in crawl method rather than fixed.
Save searches() true to a datafile.
Think about whether some methods should be static.
JavaDoc (and maybe an extra interface or two).
A script to demo how to use the system.
The content of this readme...
