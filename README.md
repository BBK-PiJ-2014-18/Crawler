### Crawler for CW5...

##### ...will finish on Tuesday 28th April...

Need to do last few things:

JavaDoc (and maybe an extra interface or two).
The content of this readme...


#####Note on file structure:

<li>Class files go in a directory called Crawler.</li>

<li>Output will be saved in a directory called Data, within Crawler.</li>

<li>For testing to work the 11 html files need to be in a directory TestHtml inside a directory (also, sorry, called) Crawler in the directory Crawler. </li>

So the base directory Crawler contains:

(a) The class files

(b) A directory: Data (where output files are found)

(c) A directory: Crawler, which contains a directory TestHtml (which contains the 11 test html files).
